# Website

My personal portfolio website. You can view it [here](https://www.tuantrann.work/).

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Portfolio Download

If you are interested in my custom theme, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tuantran0910/docs.git

    cd docs

    npm install
    ```

## Usage

### Local Development

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run start
    ```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. The default port is 3000.

### Build

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

I am using Vercel for deployment. You can deploy your own website using Vercel by following the instructions [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment).
